## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: File Upload Fails
**Solution**: Ensure your CSV file is named exactly `IPL_matches.csv` and is in proper CSV format

### Issue: Visualizations Don't Display
**Solution**: Make sure you run all cells in order. Use "Runtime" → "Run all"

### Issue: Missing Libraries
**Solution**: Google Colab includes all required libraries by default. No installation needed.

### Issue: Download Doesn't Work
**Solution**: Check your browser's download settings. Files are saved in Colab environment regardless.

### Issue: Memory Error
**Solution**: The dataset is small (~2MB), should not cause memory issues. Try "Runtime" → "Restart runtime"
